At first, I was overwhelmed and didn\u2019t know where to look due to the number of files present. The first thing that came to mind was to forge some session cookies since the APP_KEY of Laravel was in the .env file. Also, because it required the session to be set to is_admin in order to display the flag. We can see this from the following lines of code in the index.blade.php file under the resources/views/users folder: @if (isset($flag) && session()->has('is_admin') && session('is_admin')) <div class=\"flag\">Flag: {{ $flag->flag }}</div> @endif but then I discovered that it wasn\u2019t the right path. However, I realized that I needed to get an administrator account to be able to read the flag. In the web.php file under the resources/routes folder, I found all the routes of the site, including one that seemed a bit suspicious: /contact. Visiting it redirected me to the following page: Contact where the administrator accounts and their respective emails were displayed. Spoiler: only one of these was valid, which was nomanprodhan@knightconnect.com (the username of the challenge creator). I then continued looking at other files, but I was interested in how authentication was being handled, so I searched for the authentication file, which was named AuthController.php under the Http/Controllers folder. Here I found the vulnerability\u2014there were two functions that allowed you to request a login link for an account, which created a token formed by combining the email and a timestamp at that moment, all encrypted using the bcrypt function. The other function allowed you to log in using that generated link by passing the token as a parameter: public function requestLoginUrl(Request $request) { $request->validate([ 'email' => 'required|email', ]); $user = User::where('email', $request->email)->first(); if (!$user) { return back()->withErrors(['email' => 'Email not found']); } $time = time(); $data = $user->email . '|' . $time; $token = bcrypt($data); $loginUrl = url('/login-link?token=' . urlencode($token) . '&time=' . $time . '&email=' . urlencode($user->email)); return back()->with('success', 'Login link generated, but email sending is disabled.'); } public function loginUsingLink(Request $request) { $token = $request->query('token'); $time = $request->query('time'); $email = $request->query('email'); if (!$token || !$time || !$email) { return response('Invalid token or missing parameters', 400); } if (time() - $time > 3600) { return response('Token expired', 401); } $data = $email . '|' . $time; if (!Hash::check($data, $token)) { return response('Token validation failed', 401); } $user = User::where('email', $email)->first(); if (!$user) { return response('User not found', 404); } session(['user_id' => $user->id]); session(['is_admin' => $user->is_admin]); return redirect()->route('users'); } the first function doesn\u2019t really have any vulnerabilities, since it only shows how the token is created to request the \u201cinstant\u201d login URL. In contrast, the second function has a significant vulnerability, as the only check it does is ensure the timestamp of the generated token is at most one hour old (3600 seconds), otherwise, it becomes invalid. However, we can manipulate the timestamp ourselves by passing a fake value as a parameter. In fact, to make it secure, the generated token with the timestamp should have been saved in the database, and if it wasn\u2019t the exact timestamp, it wouldn\u2019t allow access (although a brute-force attack could be used to try all possible timestamps). So, I realized that it\u2019s possible to forge a token\u2014one just needs to know the email of the account they want to access, and as we saw earlier in the /contact route, there were quite a few admin emails\u2026 Now that we\u2019ve figured it all out, let\u2019s proceed with the exploit.

I also found this website useful for generating \u201cpasswords\u201d with Laravel\u2019s bcrypt (https://fbutube.com/laravel-password-generator). However, in the end, I decided to write it in PHP and run it locally, as this way I could fully automate the process. Exploitation After obtaining the admin\u2019s email nomanprodhan@knightconnect.com, it was quite simple to forge a token, since it was made up of \u201cemail|timestamp\u201d. I then wrote a PHP script that did exactly what the first function did, using bcrypt on the string formed by the admin\u2019s email + timestamp, and then generating a link similar to the one in the function with the parameters token, time, and email. This way, I created a valid login link, since the user associated with the email actually existed. I gained access to their account, and by visiting the homepage as seen earlier, with the is_admin flag on the account, I was able to retrieve the flag. Flag capture Manual Flag ",

        "content": "Initial Analysis The site appeared as follows: Site Presentation There was nothing interesting here, so I began reading the attached files. The first thing I did was read the web.php file located in the routes folder. I found the following routes: Route::get('/calculator', [CalculatorController::class, 'index']); Route::post('/calculator', [CalculatorController::class, 'calculate']); // Handle form submission Route::get('/convert', [UnitConversionController::class, 'index']); Route::post('/convert', [UnitConversionController::class, 'convert']); Route::get('/character-count', [StringManipulationController::class, 'characterCountIndex']); Route::post('/character-count', [StringManipulationController::class, 'characterCount']); Route::get('/reverse-string', [StringManipulationController::class, 'reverseStringIndex']); Route::post('/reverse-string', [StringManipulationController::class, 'reverseString']); Route::post('/profile', [ProfileController::class, 'index']); Route::get('/profile/error', [ProfileController::class, 'triggerError']); // Error-triggering route Route::get('/', function () { return view('welcome'); Next, I read the .env file and found something interesting: APP_NAME=Laravel APP_ENV=local APP_KEY=base64:KnrD53eO60BJBvCVGNlBuOqktUCAsTuod34OelLJjPQ= APP_DEBUG=true APP_URL=http://localhost MAX_CALC_LIMIT=100000000000000000 LOG_CHANNEL=stack LOG_DEPRECATIONS_CHANNEL=null LOG_LEVEL=debug DB_CONNECTION=mysql DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 DB_PORT=3306 DB_DATABASE=laravel DB_USERNAME=root DB_PASSWORD= BROADCAST_DRIVER=log CACHE_DRIVER=file FILESYSTEM_DISK=local QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync SESSION_DRIVER=file SESSION_LIFETIME=120 FLAG=KCTF{i_am_not_flag} Aside from the APP_KEY and FLAG, as we can see, Laravel\u2019s debug mode is enabled. When debug mode is enabled in Laravel, any error that occurs will trigger a detailed error page. This page includes: Error Message: A clear description of the error. Stack Trace: A full trace of the error, showing the file paths and lines of code where the issue occurred. Environment Details: Information about the environment, including variables, configurations, and request headers. Sensitive Data Exposure: Potential exposure of .env values, database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information. So, I thought about exploiting the enabled debug mode in Laravel to capture the flag. The only thing I needed was a way to trigger any kind of error. I found this method in the /calculator route, to be more precise, in the CalculatorController.php file under the Http/Controllers folder. As we can see, by entering a number greater than MAX_CALC_LIMIT=100000000000000000 an exception is thrown: <?php namespace App\\Http\\Controllers; use Illuminate\\Http\\Request; class CalculatorController extends Controller { public function index() { return view('calculator'); } public function calculate(Request $request) { $request->validate([ 'num1' => 'required|numeric', 'num2' => 'required|numeric', 'operation' => 'required|in:add,sub,mul,div', ]); $num1 = $request->input('num1'); $num2 = $request->input('num2'); $operation = $request->input('operation'); $limit = env('MAX_CALC_LIMIT', 100000); if ($num1 > $limit || $num2 > $limit) { throw new \\Exception(\"You have hit the calculation limit set in the .env file.\"); } $result = match ($operation) { 'add' => $num1 + $num2, 'sub' => $num1 - $num2, 'mul' => $num1 * $num2, 'div' => $num2 != 0 ? $num1 / $num2 : throw new \\Exception(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\"), }; return view('calculator', ['result' => $result]); } } ",

So, the decoded base64 seems to be reflected on the page, as we can see from the previous screenshot. It seems that since it mentions YAML, this could be a case of YAML insecure deserialization.

Since Python has a library called PyYAML, we can exploit the deserialization process to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). ",
