That’s when I realized that registering was pointless. Inspecting the page source, I found a strange comment: the comment revealed an email, most likely belonging to the account containing the flag. Continuing to explore the site since it was a black-box challenge without any files I found the “Forgot Password” section: Where it was possible to specify an email to reset a password. At this point, I thought about resetting the password for the account associated with the email I had found earlier. And I considered a Host Header Injection.
