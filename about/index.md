# About Me

<br>
Hi, I'm Matteo Maccarone, a passionate computer science enthusiast with a particular interest in cybersecurity. I've always aimed to combine my curiosity with a passion for cybersecurity, approaching every new project with enthusiasm and dedication.

## Who Am I

I consider myself a very curious person with a strong passion for knowledge. Over the years, I’ve developed skills in programming and cybersecurity.

Outside of my work, I enjoy traveling and playing CTF (Capture The Flag), which helps me maintain a balance between creativity and productivity.

## What I Do

I’m currently a university student, and I occasionally try my hand at bug bounty work. In my work, I focus on finding new ways to protect web applications. Every project offers me the opportunity to improve, learn something new, and contribute to the progress of cybersecurity in a meaningful way.

In my free time, I also enjoy reading and watching movies or TV series.

## My Vision

I firmly believe that this world is still full of things to discover. My mission is to become an established penetration tester, contributing positively to the field of cybersecurity.
